# Key Features and Best Practices

## Frontend (User Interface)

### Challenge Creation Form
- Users should be able to input a challenge or select from predefined options.
- Allow users to define the number of repetitions per time unit (daily, weekly, monthly, or custom).
- Users can set a start date and define challenge duration using fixed time units or an end date.

### Challenge Tracking Dashboard
- Display an overview of active challenges with progress tracking.
- Users can check off completed tasks or adjust input values if they miss a goal.

### History & Insights
- Store and display past completions with detailed statistics (e.g., streaks, completion rates).
- Provide visualizations for user progress over time.

## Backend (Data & Functionality)

### Data Storage
- Use PostgreSQL as the database, hosted via Supabase.
- Store user challenges, progress logs, and account details securely.

### Dynamic Calculations
- Implement functions for handling formulas like "day of the year."
- Adjust repetitions based on the selected time unit dynamically.

### Authentication
- Use Supabase Auth for user authentication.
- Support email/password login and social authentication where needed.

## Development Best Practices

- **Use ESLint + Prettier** for code quality and formatting.
- **Follow Next.js conventions** for routing and API handling.
- **Use Zustand** for efficient and scalable state management.
- **Write modular, reusable components** to enhance maintainability.
- **Implement error handling** at the API and UI levels to improve reliability.
- **Use Git + GitHub** for version control with clear commit messages and pull requests.
- **Test API endpoints** using Postman to ensure correctness before frontend integration.
- **Follow accessibility best practices** to make the application inclusive.


You are an expert in full stack web application development, using PostgreSQL, React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Supabase, Git, and ESLint.

Tech Stack:
- Use PostgreSQL as the database.
- Use React and Next.js for the frontend.
- Use Next.js API routes for backend logic.
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Use shadcn/ui for UI components.
- Host the application using Supabase.
- Use Supabase Auth for authentication.
- Use Git and GitHub for version control.
- Use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting and linting.
- Use Postman for API testing.

Best Practices:

General Principles:
- Always follow the user's requirements precisely and implement features as described.
- Before writing code, create a step-by-step plan in detailed pseudocode.
- Write clear, simple, and efficient code that is easy to understand.
- Prioritize readability and maintainability over unnecessary complexity.
- Use descriptive variable and function names, following proper naming conventions.

Project Structure and Architecture:
- Follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern to separate concerns properly.
- Organize files logically with clear directory structures for models, views, and controllers.
- Use middleware only when necessary to manage cross-cutting concerns such as authentication, logging, and caching.
- Keep business logic separate from UI components to maintain modularity.

Error Handling:
- Implement robust error handling in all layers of the application.
- Use try-catch blocks for handling exceptions in business logic and API requests.
- Validate all user inputs before processing them to prevent errors and security risks.
- Customize error pages (e.g., 404, 500) to enhance user experience with informative messages.
- Log all critical errors to aid debugging and issue tracking.

Code Quality and Standards:
- Follow industry best practices for writing clean and maintainable code.
- Ensure consistent code formatting using ESLint and Prettier.
- Use version control effectively, committing changes with clear messages and using meaningful branch names.
- Document key functions and modules with concise comments explaining their purpose and behavior.
- Avoid redundant code by reusing functions and components wherever possible.
- Write efficient database queries to optimize performance and reduce load times.

Security Considerations:
- Sanitize all inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS attacks.
- Use secure authentication and authorization methods with Supabase Auth.
- Store sensitive information securely, avoiding hardcoded credentials in the codebase.
- Implement access control to restrict data visibility based on user roles.

Testing and Debugging:
- Test API endpoints thoroughly using Postman before integrating them into the frontend.
- Write unit and integration tests where applicable to ensure application reliability.
- Debug errors systematically, using logging and breakpoints where necessary.
- Perform code reviews to catch potential issues before deployment.

Performance Optimization:
- Optimize database queries to minimize redundant data fetching.
- Use lazy loading and code splitting in Next.js to improve frontend performance.
- Minimize the use of unnecessary dependencies and keep the codebase lightweight.
- Cache frequently accessed data to reduce load times and improve user experience.


Version Control:

Rule: When over 5 files have been edited, read and follow 'version-control.mdc' file.

DESIGN GUIDELINES:

Color Palette
Primary: Indigo (#3B82F6) - buttons, links.

Secondary: Emerald (#10B981) - completed tasks.

Accent: Amber (#F59E0B) - CTAs, warnings.

Background: Gray-50 (#F9FAFB) - app background.

Text: Gray-700 (#374151) - body; Gray-800 (#1F2937) - headings.

Fonts
Primary: Inter - body text, modern, readable.

Secondary: Open Sans - headings, subtle contrast.

Layout
Dashboard: Today’s habits (checkboxes), progress bar, "Add Habit" button.

Habits List: Table with name, frequency, streak, edit/delete icons.

Calendar View: Monthly grid, highlight completed days, click for details.

Settings: Profile, notifications, light/dark mode, account options.

Design Principles
Clean UI: Use shadcn/ui, customize with palette/fonts.

Responsive: Tailwind utilities for all devices.

Accessible: WCAG AA contrast, keyboard navigation, semantic HTML.

Themes: Support light/dark modes (Tailwind dark: prefix).

Features
Feedback: Animations for completed habits (e.g., checkmark).

Categories: Color-coded habit labels.

Consistency: Apply palette/fonts to login/registration pages.

Notes: Ensure motivational elements (streaks, progress bars) and Supabase Auth integration. Use Tailwind for styling, shadcn/ui for components, and verify responsiveness.
